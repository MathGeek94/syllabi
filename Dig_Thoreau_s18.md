Course description
------------------

What does "critical reading" look like in the digital age? We'll attempt to answer this question not only by learning how a new generation of "digital humanists" is approaching the task of editing, analyzing, interpreting, and contextualizing texts, but also by using digital tools to advance our own critical understanding of works by American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau. Students in this course will apply what they learn about text encoding, computational text analysis, and other tools directly to SUNY Geneseo's ongoing digital project about Thoreau at http://digitalthoreau.org.
